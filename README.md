# Viterbi-Decoder
Matlab Implementation of  the Viterbi Decoder
This program asks length of code(l),number of outputs to be generated for input of one bit(nc), the constrain length(kc)
the program then generated a random bit sequence of given, encodes the generator polynomial using a random generator polynomial,errors are added to the encoded word and then decoded using viterbi decoding algorithm, trellis diagram
