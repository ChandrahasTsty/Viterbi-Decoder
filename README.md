# Viterbi-Decoder
Matlab Implementation of  the Viterbi Decoder
This program asks number of outputs to be generated for input of one bit(nc),length of code(l), the constrain length(kc), number of errors to be added to the encoded code word, the program then generates a random bit sequence of given length, encodes the generator polynomial using a random generator polynomial,errors are added to the encoded word and then decoded using viterbi decoding algorithm, trellis diagram
